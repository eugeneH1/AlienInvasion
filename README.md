# AlienInvasion project from Python Crash Course, 2nd edition.

It's a game written in Python using the pygame library.

What's different in my game?
I've added a bomb that deploys every nth level. The bomb is a sprite that moves from the ship much like bullets, when it collides it creates an explosion which is another sprite that grows and collides with aliens. It awards more points than collisions with a bullet.
